<h1>FlAVOURS</h1>
<p>There are so many wonderful flavours to try of Josh's Pink Drink.</p>
<h3><strong>Original/Pink</strong></h3>
	<p> The Original drink that many have been in love with since the day it appeared. With the iconic flavour of pink, and a huge amount of sugar, it's a masterpiece*.</p>

	<h3>Pink +</h3>
	<p> As iconic as the original, and critics say it's better, personally we love either. Pink + it's as crazy as an alpaca eating a banana.</p>

	<h3>Pink No Maltodextrin</h3>
	<p> Do you love Josh's Pink Drink, but are worried about the amount of maltodextrin you are consuming? Fair enough! We made a healthy version for the whole family, still with plenty of sugar, but not as much maltodextrin!</p>

<h3>Pink Burger Flavour</h3>
	<p> Created by Chef Shrek, Burger Flavour is one of the strangest but loveliest flavours you'll ever taste. We guarantee*.</p>

	<h3>Pink Basketball Flavour</h3>
	<p> Tested* by Michael Jordan and Lebron James, and they both agree, it tastes like a basketball.</p>

<h3>Orange Flavoured Pink</h3>
<p>This brand new flavour that released this year is crazy. We can't even describe orange flavoured pink. Here are a very small percentage of reviews. </p>

<p>Michael Jordan: 5/5 - It tastes better than other orange flavoured drinks, and I can still taste the pink!</p>
	<p>Rick Astley: 5/5 - Me and orange flavoured pink are best friends.</p>
	<p>Anthony Albanese: 5/5 - Literally the best thing I've seen since the new budget.</p>
	<p> * means we're lying.</p>
