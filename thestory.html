	<h3>Josh Pinkaham in 1843</h3> 
<p>In 1826, Australian, Josh Pinkaham was born. In 1840, at 14, tired of the terrible soft drinks on the market, he made a recipe for a drink called "Yellow." After tasting it, he deemed it disgusting. But after three years of experimentation, he made a drink with an extreme colour of pink. He went to Preston, bought a small amount of land, and decided to make a shop called "Josh's Pink Drink Shop." And, hence, he named his drink, "Josh's Pink Drink." </p>
<p> After creating Josh's Pink Drink, it was an instant hit, and everyone thought it was the best soft drink ever created, which it is. In 1874, Josh released Josh's Pink Drink +. Josh Pinkaham died a billionare in his mansion in Preston in 1901. It is a classic drink, but it has expanded from it's humble beginning, it has become better, smarter, orangier.&nbsp; Long Live Josh's Pink Drink!</p>
